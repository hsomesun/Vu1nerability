The firmware version of the test device is **wr740nv5_en_ipv6_3_16_9_up_boot(180328).bin**. Current latest version. Of course, these vulnerabilities also apply to firmware updated at a unified time, such as V6, V4, etc.
### Details
The vulnerability exists in the httpd program, request: `WlanNetworkRpm_APC.htm`,`WlanNetworkRpm_AP.htm`,`WlanNetworkRpm.htm`

The program processes these three requests from the user by calling the function 0x46873c. The vulnerability occurred in function 0x0046873c. The program uses `strncpy` after obtaining the parameter` newBridgessid`. `__n` is the length of the parameter value calculated directly through` strlen`. It can trigger a stack overflow by sending a very long data packet.
### POC

### Result
Triggering a stack overflow will crash the web service and fail to restart automatically, resulting in the inaccessibility of other users connected to this wifi, requiring manual restart of the device to return to normal.

### Suggestions for repair
Add check of copy length before calling `strncpy` function.
