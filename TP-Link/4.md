The firmware version of the test device is **wr740nv5_en_ipv6_3_16_9_up_boot(180328).bin**. Current latest version. Of course, these vulnerabilities also apply to firmware updated at a unified time, such as V6, V4, etc.
### Details
The vulnerability exists in the httpd program, request: `WzdWlanSiteSurveyRpm_AP.htm`

The vulnerability lies in the function 0x4620a0 that is called when the program processes the popupSiteSurveyRpm.htm requested by the user. The program uses `strncpy` after obtaining the parameter` ssid`. `__n` is the length of the parameter value calculated directly through` strlen`. It can trigger a stack overflow by sending a very long data packet.
### POC
Similarly, use Burpsuite to capture the packet and fill in the long field, then replay triggers the service crash
### Result
Triggering a stack overflow will crash the web service and fail to restart automatically, resulting in the inaccessibility of other users connected to this wifi, requiring manual restart of the device to return to normal.
