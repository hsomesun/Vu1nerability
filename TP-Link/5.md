The firmware version of the test device is **wr740nv5_en_ipv6_3_16_9_up_boot(180328).bin**. Current latest version. Of course, these vulnerabilities also apply to firmware updated at a unified time, such as V6, V4, etc.

The vulnerability exists in the httpd program, it's configuration file overflow.
Vulnerability occurs when the configuration file is uploaded. By constructing a malicious configuration file and encrypting it according to the original configuration file encryption algorithm, overflow can be triggered after uploading. At this time, not only the web service crash, the device will restart and restore to the original factory state
