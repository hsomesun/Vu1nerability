Hi, I'm eack from Codesafe team of Legendsec at Qi'anxin Group .

Recently, I discovered that there is a command injection vulnerability in netgear's WNDR4300v2 router. The firmware version tested was v1.0.0.58. The details of the vulnerability are as follows:


Vulnerability location:
In NETGEAR Downloader (BETA), when using emule download, the ip and port parameters are not filtered, resulting in remote command injection.

First you have to make sure that USB is plugged into the router.

Then you need to turn on wireshark to monitor WLAN traffic.

Finally, you can verify the vulnerability by simply capturing, modifying, and replaying the packet through BurpSuite.

The location of the vulnerability in the code:

Because IP and port parameters have a command injection vulnerability.
