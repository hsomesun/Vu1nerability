Hi, I'm eack from Codesafe team of Legendsec at Qi'anxin Group .

Recently, I discovered that there is a command injection vulnerability in netgear's WNDR4300v2 router. The firmware version tested was v1.0.0.58. The details of the vulnerability are as follows:


Vulnerability location:

In the NETGEAR Downloader (BETA) management interface, when the download item in the download task table is processed, the select_ids parameter is not filtered, resulting in command injection.

The operations involved are recovery, pause, delete. 

The three tasks in the download task table can be added by above, and the downloaded url can be non-existent in order to be displayed in the task bar.

Of course, there is no special requirement for the number of download tasks, this is just the amount I added in the test.


Take pause operation as an example:
